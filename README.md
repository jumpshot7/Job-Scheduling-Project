Java program that runs FIFO, Shortest Job Algorithm (non-premptive,) Shortest Remaming Job Algorithm (pre-emptive,) "Highest Priority Algorithm, and Round-Robin with and without context switch for a set of simulated jobs.
All algorithms have been analyzed by collecting turn around time, and through-put for a fixed length of time.
Output includes a table showing balues for each algorithm, and calculates the average turn around time.

Jobs have been randomly generated and stored as job objects. Program will generate 25 jobs, simulate the algorithms, and display their info in the table.
